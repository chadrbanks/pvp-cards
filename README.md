This game can be played with 2 or more players, and is generally played in 2 teams.
Players take turns completing actions trying to deal damage and eliminate each other from the game.

## Objective
The object of PVPCards is to deal enough damage to all of your enemies to knock them out.
You want to be the last person or team standing.

## Components
The game is currently made up of a single set of 48 cards.
Currently, you must print these and cut them out manually.

## Setup
Have a random player shuffle and deal 3 cards to everyone.
The dealer should deal the final cards face up.
If you suspect that the player is a sneaky rogue, then play multiple games having players take turns dealing in a clockwise rotation.

## Turn Order
The player with the highest card value wins initiative and goes first.
If there is a tie, the card type can be used to break a tie.
There are currently 4 card types.
Listed in priority order from highest to lowest is Green, Red, Yellow, Blue.
Implying that a green card will always win a ties and a blue card will always lose.

Once the player with initiative is established, he declares himself on Blue team.
The next player to his left is declared on Red team, and the pattern of Blue and Red back and fourth continues until all players are on a team.
If there is an odd number of players then the last player does not declare Blue team and instead becomes the true rogue.
This player is now independant for this hand and is able to change teams at will, or stay independant.
This means they can declare Blue or Red from the onset or just declare Rogue.

## Rounds
The player with initiative takes their turn by playing any one card they want, and they only discard the played card or draw any new cards if they are instructed to do so on the card being played.
Then turn order proceeds to their left, and play continues as players are dealt damage and knocked out.
If a character runs out of cards in their hand, they are knocked out and forced to discard any cards in front of them.
Players who have had the misfortune of being eliminated do not get to draw or take turns unless an active player plays a card that instructs them to do so. 

## End
Turns continue until only one team (or player) is left.
Winners are then declared, and you can shuffle and play the next game.
